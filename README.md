Hello everyone,

I have created a personal planner web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can view the web page by running the index.html file in your browser. Here are the steps to view the web page:

1.Clone or download the repository from the following link:
[Personal-Planner GitHub Repository](https://github.com/grishaharutyunyan/Personal-Planner-)

2.Navigate to the downloaded directory on your computer.

3.Find the index.html file and open it using a web browser. You can also double-click the file to automatically open it in your default browser.

4.The personal planner web page should now be visible in your browser. Feel free to explore its functionality and let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
Thank you!
